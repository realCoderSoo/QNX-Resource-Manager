# QNX-Resource-Manager
The program operates a metronome using timers, and accepts pulses to pause the metronome for a number of seconds. To avoid noisy chaos in the lab, we’ll use visual output for the “click” of the metronome. A functional requirement has the metronome pause, which is done from the console using the echo command to send (i.e. write) pause 4 to the metronome device: 
# echo pause 4 > /dev/local/metronome This means that the metronome will be implemented as a QNX resource manager for the “/dev/local/metronome” device. 
The resource manager code (i.e., the io_write(…) function) should send a pulse to the main thread of the metronome to have the metronome thread pause for the 
specified number of seconds. The “pause x” should pause the metronome for x seconds, where x is any integer value from 1 through 9, inclusive. 
Notice the metronome resmgr is multi-threaded: main thread (resmgr) and metronome thread (interval timer). 
The metronome program accepts three parameters from the command-line: # metronome beats-per-minute time-signature-top time-signature-bottom For example: 
# metronome 100 2 4 With output: |1&amp;2&amp; |1&amp;2&amp; |1&amp;2&amp; |… (the “|1” characters occur every 2*60/100 = 1.2 sec per measure) 
Another example: # metronome 200 5 4 With output: |1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4-5- |1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4-5- |1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4-5- |… 
(the “|1” characters occur every 5*60/200 = 1.5 sec per measure)
